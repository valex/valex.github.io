<div class="col-sm-8"><p><a href="https://t.me/hamster_komBat_bot/start?startapp=kentId133205093" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hamster Kombat</a> is an app that allows users to step into the role of a crypto exchange director and earn tokens through tapping, collecting coins, upgrading passive income, developing their own income strategy, and recruiting new players.</p><p>The project doesn't have a Whitepaper yet, but it is promised to be released soon. The project's roadmap extends until the end of 2024, with the launch of an in-game utility token planned for July 2024. Additionally, offline events are expected in the third quarter, among other things.</p><h3>How to start playing Hamster Kombat</h3><p>You don't need to download a separate app to <a href="https://t.me/hamster_komBat_bot/start?startapp=kentId133205093" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">play Hamster Kombat</a>. The game is integrated into the <a href="https://t.me/hamster_komBat_bot/start?startapp=kentId133205093" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Telegram messenger</a> and can be launched through a special bot. Simply grant it permission to send messages, and then you can start farming Hamster Coin.</p><p>Hamster Kombat will appear in your list of chats. In the chat, you need to click on 'Play' in the text input field. It is important to note that the app only works on the mobile version. If it is launched from the desktop version, it will display a QR code for your smartphone.</p><h3>How to farm Hamster Coin: Step by step</h3><p>There are several main ways to earn more coins in the app. Firstly, it's worth inviting new players to register using your referral link. You can earn between 5,000 and 25,000 coins depending on whether the invited person has a Telegram Premium subscription. Additionally, users will receive bonuses for the level-up of their referrals.</p><p>The second key method of earning tokens is through 'secret' combos, which allow you to instantly get 5 million coins. Information on the actions needed to perform these combos is available online, so to save time, simply 'Google' it.</p><p>Passive income is one of the key ways to progress your hamster. In the 'Mine' section, purchase as many different cards as possible and then upgrade them. However, keep in mind that the cost of upgrading cards increases as they level up, while their income may become less significant. To keep up with collecting profits, you need to log into the game every three hours.</p><p>Another method of earning tokens is through the cipher. You can access this section by tapping 'Profit from Tap' several times. This will open a window with a daily cipher consisting of long and short dashes. Holding your finger on the screen longer will produce a long dash, while a quick tap will produce a short dash.</p><p>The cipher updates every 32 hours, and users usually post the correct version online. Solving the cipher can earn you up to 5 million tokens.</p><p>The last method of earning tokens in the app is by completing daily tasks. Simply open the game every day to receive coins. By the tenth day, the payout will reach 6 million coins.</p></div>
